# todo
CMPT251 Linux Project: To-Do App

Hi, person grading this assignment ( Dalton? <3 ), here's some stuff to save you some time:

If you want to do stuff via command line: ./todo (whatever) "" as normal
If you want to access the menu via command line: ./todo menu
If you want to access the menu without specifying you can also just ./todo

If you fuck up, you'll see the help command page and then you'll start over. 

You can totes play around with existing files already in the todo and toDone lists.

In case you were wondering - toDone is the list of the completed items.

Press q to quit when you return to the menu, or just give up, whatever.
